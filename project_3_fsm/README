# FSM Sequence Detector (1011) in Verilog

## Description

This project implements a 4-state finite state machine (FSM) designed to detect the bit sequence `1011`. The FSM is coded in Verilog using two `always` blocks:
- One for state transitions triggered on the rising edge of the clock and asynchronous reset.
- One for output logic driven by the current state and input bit.

The FSM outputs a high signal when the sequence `1011` has been detected.

## Module Details

### `fsm_2_always`

- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock input.
  - `rst`: Asynchronous active-high reset.
  - `in_bit`: Serial input bit stream.
- **Output:**
  - `out`: High when the sequence `1011` is detected.

The FSM uses four parameters for states: `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, encoded as 2-bit constants.

---

## Testbench `tb_fsm_2_always`

- Drives clock, reset, and input bit sequences.
- Contains simulation stimulus to verify detection of sequence `1011`.
- Includes waveform dumping commands for VCD generation.

---

## Simulation

### Tools used:

- [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) for compilation and execution.
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) for waveform viewing.

### Compilation and Simulation Commands:

```
# Compile Verilog source files (testbench and FSM module)
iverilog -o output_file.vvp tb_fsm_2_always.v fsm_2_always.v

# Run the simulation
vvp output_file.vvp
```

### Viewing Waveforms:

The simulation generates a waveform file `fsm_waveform.vcd`. Open it with GTKWave:

```
gtkwave fsm_waveform.vcd
```

Make sure the testbench has the following lines enabled to generate the waveform file:

```
initial begin
    $dumpfile("fsm_waveform.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, tb_fsm_2_always);
end
```

---

## Notes

- Uncomment the clock generation loop inside the testbench to enable the clock signal during simulation.
- The reset is active-high and asynchronous.
- The output logic uses the current state and input bit to assert detection.
- The code is structured for clear separation of sequential and combinational logic.
